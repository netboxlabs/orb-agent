# Secrets Manager

The secrets manager resolves secret references when a policy is applied, so
credentials live in your secret store rather than in `agent.yaml`. A policy
writes a reference where the value would go:

```yaml
scope:
  - driver: ios
    hostname: 192.0.2.10
    username: admin
    password: "${vault://secret/devices/password}"
```

One provider is active at a time, selected by `orb.secrets_manager.active`, and
configured under `sources`:

```yaml
orb:
  secrets_manager:
    active: vault
    sources:
      vault:
        address: "https://vault.example.com:8200"
```

| Provider | `active` | Reference form |
|:--|:--|:--|
| [HashiCorp Vault](vault.md) | `vault` | `${vault://<mount>/<path>/<key>}` |
| [Doppler](doppler.md) | `doppler` | `${doppler://<project>/<config>/<secret>}` |
| [CyberArk (CCP)](cyberark.md) | `cyberark` | `${cyberark://<Safe>/<Object>/<Field>}` |
| [Delinea Secret Server](delinea.md) | `delinea` | `${delinea://path/<folder>/<name>/<field>}` |
| [Delinea DevOps Secrets Vault (DSV)](dsv.md) | `dsv` | `${dsv://<secret-path>/<field-key>}` |

Each provider's page documents its own reference forms in full, since most
accept more than one.

Leaving `active` unset or empty skips the secrets manager and the agent starts
normally. A value that is set but not recognised fails startup with an error
naming the supported types.

The provider and its settings can also be chosen entirely from the environment,
without editing the YAML, which suits injecting them at deploy time. See
[Environment-Driven Configuration](../advanced_config/env_config.md).

## Rotation

Every provider takes an optional `schedule`, a cron expression for re-fetching
secrets that have already been resolved. When a referenced value changes, the
policies that used it are re-applied with the new value, so credentials can be
rotated without restarting the agent. Each provider's page covers what happens
when a re-fetch fails.
